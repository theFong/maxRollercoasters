# Rollercoaster Dynamic Programming Problem

Corey loves riding rollercoasters, but hates waiting in lines. Luckily for him, he has a crystal ball that tells him for each rollercoaster i a time ti when there is no line. However, he wants to ride the rollercoasters in increasing thrill factor order. Corey assigns each rollercoaster i a thrill factor fi.

### What is the maximum number of rollercoasters he can ride?

Constraints: 0 ≤ ti, fi ≤ 109. All ti values will be distinct. All fi values will be distinct. Your code will need to run in O(n2) (where n is the number of roller-coasters) in order to pass all test cases.
